By: Dianne Caravela

Requirments for paper for submission to USCLAP competition:

The research question(s).
Background/significance of the research.
The methods used to obtain and analyze the data.
The results of the analysis (tables, charts, graphs, significance, confidence intervals, descriptive text).
A discussion of the research, the limitations of the current research, reasonableness of any assumptions made, possibilities of future work/studies that should be conducted, etc.
In addition to the 3 page paper, you may have (in the same file) a blinded title page which includes: The title of the project and a one-paragraph abstract of the project (recommended length of no more than 150 words).
References should be listed at the end of the paper and do not count against the 3 page limit.
The entire written summary must be no more than 3 pages (single spaced, 11pt or 12pt font with standard 1 inch margins).

(Optional) You may include up to 5 additional pages of information about your project in an appendix (as part of the single uploaded file).  This could include secondary analysis results, charts/tables, etc. The optional appendix may be reviewed by judges at their discretion, if questions arise when reading the 3 page paper.  There is no guarantee of this additional review; thus no information deemed critical to the evaluation of your project should be included in the Appendix.
